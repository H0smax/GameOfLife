# GameOfLife
Conway's Game Of Life (no border wrapping)

Run GameOfLife.py and enjoy!
You can change the room size and the refresh rate changing their variables.
A bigger roomSize takes more time to process.
A refresh time too small is not shown due to matplotlib nature. I would suggest a value between 0.1s and 10s (or bigger if you want to study the room)
